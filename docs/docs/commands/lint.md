# Lint

`scope lint` is used to validate configurations without needing to run large samples.

When run `scope lint` will check:
- `ScopeReportLocation`

To validate `ScopeReportLocation`'s, inputs are generated and templates are rendered. This allows report templates to be validated before they exposed to others.
