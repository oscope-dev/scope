# ScopeReportLocation

Define a report, what it includes, what it looks like, and where to upload to.

## Templates

By default, scope has 3 provided templates `title`, `analyze`, and `doctor`.

`title` is used to determine the title of the issue (if supported), `analyze` is used when `scope analyze` is run,
and `doctor` is used when `scope doctor` is run.

Each of those templates are defined in a Jinja2 format, and they have different options available.

| variable | description | example input | available in |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `entrypoint` | The `scope` command run | `scope doctor run` | `title`, `analyze`, `doctor` |
| `command` | The `scope` command run | `scope doctor run` | `analyze`, `doctor` |
| `groups` | Output from each group run with doctor | `{ name: string, actions: []{ check: [], fix: [], validate: [] }, additional_data: [string]:string` | `doctor` |
| `additionalData` | Additional data from location | `[]{ name: string, command: string, output: string }` | `doctor`, `analyze` |
| `result` | Output from the command | `{command: string, exit_code: i32, start_time: string, end_time: string, output: string}` | `analyze` |

### GitHub Issues

When reporting to GitHub Issues, the env-var `SCOPE_GH_TOKEN` must be set to get the API token.
When reporting to GitHub Issues, multiple authentication methods are supported:
1. [GitHub App](https://docs.github.com/en/apps): `SCOPE_GH_APP_ID` and `SCOPE_GH_APP_KEY`
1. Personal Access Token: `SCOPE_GH_TOKEN`

```yaml
---
apiVersion: scope.github.com/v1alpha
kind: ScopeReportLocation
metadata:
  name: github
spec:
  destination:
    githubIssue:
      owner: ethankhall
      repo: dummy-repo
```

### RustyPaste

[RustyPaste](https://github.com/orhun/rustypaste) is a pastebin style application. This may be a better choice when you can't require GitHub API token, or if there is a risk of sensitive data that shouldn't be in GitHub.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: scope.github.com/v1alpha
kind: ScopeReportLocation
metadata:
  name: report
spec:
  destination:
    rustyPaste:
      url: http://localhost:8000
```

### Schema

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="Viewer" label="Viewer" default>
        <JSONSchemaViewer schema={Schema} />
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="JSON Schema" label='JSON Schema'>
        <CodeBlock language="json-schema">{JSON.stringify(Schema, null, 2)}</CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>
