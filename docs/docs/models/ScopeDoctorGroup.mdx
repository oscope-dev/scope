# ScopeDoctorGroup

A "group" is a set of operations that should be preformed as part of solving a problem.
For example, there may be a group to install and configure Node, or other language.

A Group is defined by one or more "actions".
Taking a look at an example

```yaml
apiVersion: scope.github.com/v1alpha
kind: ScopeDoctorGroup
metadata:
  name: node
spec:
  include: by-default
  description: Check node is ready.
  needs:
    - python
    - brew
  actions:
    - description: Node Version
      name: node-version
      check:
        paths:
          - '.npmrc'
        commands:
          - ./scripts/check-node-version.sh
      fix:
        commands:
          - ./scripts/fix-node-version.sh
        helpText: Running into errors reach out in #foo-help
        helpUrl: https://go.example.com/get-help
      required: false
    - description: Install packages
      name: yarn
      check:
        paths:
          - 'package.json'
          - '**/package.json'
          - yarn.lock
          - '**/yarn.lock'
      fix:
        commands:
          - yarn install
```

In the example above, there are two actions, the first ensures that node is operational.

## Actions

An action is a discrete step, they run in order defined.
The action should be atomic, and target a single resolution.

Notice an action can provide both `paths` and `commands`, if either of them indicate that the fix should run, it will run.
In the event there are no defined check, the fix will _always_ run.

`paths` indicate a fix should run when:
1. No files match any of the `path` globs, or
2. Any of the matching files contents have changed

## Fix

When the checks determine that something isn't correct, a fix is the way to automate the resolution.
When provided, `scope` will run them in order.

## Commands

A command can either be relative, or use the PATH.
To target a script relative to the group it must start with `.`, and giving a relative path to the group file.

## Schema

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="Viewer" label="Viewer" default>
        <JSONSchemaViewer schema={Schema} />
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="JSON Schema" label='JSON Schema'>
        <CodeBlock language="json-schema">{JSON.stringify(Schema, null, 2)}</CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>
