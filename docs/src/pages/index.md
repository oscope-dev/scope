# Scope

`scope` is a tool that allows developer experience teams to provide tooling for engineers.
There are tools engineers use directly, `scope doctor`, `scope report`, and `scope analyze`.

`scope doctor` runs a set of user-defined scripts to help configure, debug, and fix an engineers environment.

`scope report` is used to report local execution error.
This is primarily used to generate a bug report, and upload it somewhere so that the responders have all the required into to respond.

`scope analyze` is used to read logs from a running system (remote or local) or command and find errors. The engineer is unable to report a bug with analyze.
